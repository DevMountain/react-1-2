# Project Summary

In this project, we will create an e-commerce React application from start to finish. We will start with the basic file structure from `create-react-app`, with the only difference being that `src/App.js` is empty. We will be working on this app over the course of three days. Each day's project is divided into four parts, with the first step being comparable to that day's mini-project and the following steps adding more features or implementing new patterns. You should expect to be able to complete the first two steps on each day, while steps three and four will offer a challenge.

# Day 2

On this day, we will be refactoring some of our code to take advantage of some of the tools that React has to offer. You should have made it to at least part 2 of Day 1 in order to proceed with this project. We will be using reusable `functional components` to follow the DRY principle, which is, don't repeat yourself. We will pass `props` into our reusable `components`. At the end of this project, you should have a better understanding of the following concepts:

- Props
- PropTypes
- Functional Components
- Reusable Components

## Part 1

### Summary

In this part we will create two functional components so that we don't have to repeat our `JSX` for a `product` in the `products section` and `cart section`. We'll make use of `props` to pass in a `product` to `render`.

## Step 1

- Create a new `components` folder inside the `src` folder.

## Step 2

- Create a new `Product functional component` inside the `components` folder.
